## Rules
### The following rules apply for all projects:
### 1. The project can be done using any libraries/frameworks you’re comfortable with.
### 2. Create a github/gitlab/bitbucket or equivalent repository to host your code.
### 3. Provide a readme for running the basic application.
### Mini projects (5-6 hours)
### Websocket game
### Create a server and client implementation of a follow-me like game. It doesn't need to have a web
### UI with it. Simple terminal based servers would suffice.
### ● When a key is pressed in server (instruction), the client receives it; and has a timer counting up to X seconds in which the same key has to be pressed.
### ● The server verifies if the keypress sent by client matched “the instruction” and assign +1 point on correct, -1 on a wrong key and 0 for timeouts.
### ● The game is over when the score reaches either +10 points or -3 points.
### ● The game is also over if the client does not respond for 3 continuous instructions.
### ● Each score update should send the score back to the connected client.
### ● The client should also know the timeout value for each instruction receive
